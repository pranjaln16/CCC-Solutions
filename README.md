# CCC-Solutions
These are my solutions to past contests from previous years. I will write these mostly in Python or other languages for learning purposes.

2021 was my first CCC competition and I got a 30, getting all the points for J1 and J2. I am eager to learn more my attempting past contests.
I will be posting my programs here.
